This software is designed to fill the gap between a discussion forum and a mailing list.  While most forum software
allows people to be updated via a mailing list it usually results in a mailing list that is less than optimal in it's
features.  It is licensed under either the `"New" BSD license <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`_ or
the `Academic Free License v3.0 <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/AFL-3.0>`_.

This forum is built around the `Dojo Toolkit <http://dojotoolkit.org/>`_ and `PHP <http://php.net/>`_.
