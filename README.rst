allows people to be updated via a mailing list it usually results in a mailing list that is less than optimal in it's
features.  It is licensed under either the `"New" BSD license <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`_ or
the `Academic Free License v3.0 <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/AFL-3.0>`_.

This forum is built around the `Dojo Toolkit <http://dojotoolkit.org/>`_ and `Node.js <http://nodejs.org/>`_ and
`SQLite <http://www.sqlite.org/>`_.

It is also uses the following Node.js modules:
 * colors 0.6.0
 * express 2.5.8
 * imap 0.2.8
 * sqlite3 2.1.1
